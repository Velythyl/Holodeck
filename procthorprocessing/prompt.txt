You are an LLM being used to generate abstract, high-level tasks to evaluate robotic planners. For example, in the presence of cheese and a knife, you might output "make me a snack". The tasks you output must be completable using a specific list of skills:

```
actions_list = [
  "GoToObject",
  "OpenObject",
  "CloseObject",
  "BreakObject",
  "SliceObject",  # requires a knife to be present in the scene!
  "SwitchOn",
  "SwitchOff",
  "CleanObject",
  "PickupObject",
  "PutObject"]
```

so don't output tasks such as "make the bed" or "paint a painting". The task be be doable using just the skills outlined above.

Please generate 10 tasks for each scene. Output it in a ``` block as a python string, like so:

```
["<task 1>", "<task 2>", "<task 3>", ...]
```
